# Markov chaining
> A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.
(From wikipedia)

You can use this concept to build somewhat real-looking sentences by creating a model where each "next word" in the sentence only depends on the current word.
This project presents an interactive, working example of markov chaining. You can find it hosted on [my website](http://http://jcrowell.net/markov/).
